//    Well this is a strange situation, We all have seen NullPointerException when we invoke a method on the object that is NULL, 
//    But here this program will work and prints â€œTest foo called .
//    The reason for this is the java compiler code optimization
//    When the java code is compiled to produced byte code, it figures out that foo() is a static method and should be called using class, 
//    So it changes the method call obj.foo () to Test.foo() and hence no NullPointerException.
